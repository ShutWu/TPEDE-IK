This project file is the source code for TPEDE and TPEDE-IK. Out of the restriction, the simulation software Coppeliasim is selected as the visualization software.

Examples include the single-point inverse kinematics testing program, *one_point_IK.py*, and the circular trajectory inverse kinematics testing program, *trajectory_IK.py*. These programs can be executed directly, but the following requirements must be met before running them:

- **Python Environment Setup**: Install the necessary dependencies according to the *requirements.txt* file.
- **CoppeliaSim Version**: Version 4.5.0 or higher is recommended, with compatibility for the ZMQ API module.
